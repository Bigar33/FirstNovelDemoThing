All the bright young things go to Jay Gatsby’s Long Island parties. Yet Gatsby himself is reserved and mysterious. He seems always to be waiting for something or someone. When he finally draws the beautiful Daisy Buchanan back into his orbit, he sets in motion a series of tragedies.

And F. Scott Fitzgerald gives us what many consider to be the greatest American novel—a crystalline portrait of a society captivated by status and ambition, and a man doomed in love.

Baz Lurhmann’s spectacular film adaptation of The Great Gatsby, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, is due for release in Australia in 2013.aspodijfpaoisdjpfoijasopijfaopsdf
